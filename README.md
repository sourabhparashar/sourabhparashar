## üí´ About Me

Hey there! I'm Sunny, an AI/ML Engineer and former Data Scientist/Analyst with 6+ years of experience turning raw, chaotic data into insights that actually help people make decisions.

I‚Äôve worked across healthcare, finance, and telecom ‚Äî building fraud detection models at HSBC, optimizing hospital operations at Apollo, and currently designing anomaly detection systems at Verizon to prevent revenue leakage. Whether it‚Äôs a predictive model, a real-time dashboard, or an ETL pipeline that just *works*, I‚Äôm the person who makes it happen.

üß∞ My toolkit includes:  
Python ‚Ä¢ SQL ‚Ä¢ Azure ‚Ä¢ PySpark ‚Ä¢ Airflow ‚Ä¢ Power BI ‚Ä¢ Tableau ‚Ä¢ TensorFlow ‚Ä¢ Scikit-learn ‚Ä¢ SHAP ‚Ä¢ Azure ML Studio

I like solving hard problems, automating boring stuff, and making sure pipelines don‚Äôt break on Monday morning. I write code that talks to data and build systems that talk to people.

If you‚Äôre into clean data, honest dashboards, and ML models that pull their weight ‚Äî we‚Äôll get along just fine.

‚òï Currently working on:  
- Smarter anomaly detection models  
- Scalable, production-ready ML pipelines  
- Using less buzzwords and more logic
